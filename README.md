## Context
Workmotion (www.workmotion.com) is a global HR platform enabling companies to hire & onboard their employees internationally, at the push of a button. It is our mission to create opportunities for anyone to work from anywhere. As work is becoming even more global and remote, there has never been a bigger chance to build a truly global HR-tech company.

## Libraries used
- bootstrap: Used for styling the app [read more here](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Typescript: Used for PropTypes validation.

## Getting Started
Need to install project dependencies depending on your packages manager

Run `npm install` Or `yarn`

## Development front server
Run `yarn start` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
:checked: You should see a list of employees
:checked: You should see a form to add a new employee
:warning: You should filter the list using the search input. `COMING SOON` - The idea would be to pair work on this during the tech discussion.

## Development back server
Run `yarn mock` to generate the dummy data from the fake server.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
